This project is aimed at building a recommender system that can be used to provide product recommendations to customers based on their past behavior and interests.

## File Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

- `Create_products_and_feature_table.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code used to create a products table and a features table from raw data.

- `Cf_approach.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code used to implement a collaborative filtering approach to build a recommendation system.

- `Cf_model.py`: This Python file contains the code used to build a collaborative filtering model.

- `Cross_section_approach.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code used to implement a cross-sectional approach to build a recommendation system.

- `Cross_section_model.py`: This Python file contains the code used to build a cross-sectional model.

- `Panel_approach.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code used to implement a panel approach to build a recommendation system.

- `Panel_model.py`: This Python file contains the code used to build a panel model.

- `model.py`: This Python file contains the code used to define the base class for all the recommendation models and to define common methods.
